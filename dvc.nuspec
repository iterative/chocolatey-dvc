    <summary>Git for data scientists - manage your code and data together</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[
**Data Version Control** or **DVC** is an **open-source** tool for data science and machine
learning projects. Key features:

* Simple **command line** Git-like experience. Does not require installing and maintaining
   any databases. Does not depend on any proprietary online services.

* Management and versioning of **datasets** and **machine learning models**. Data is saved in
   S3, Google cloud, Azure, Alibaba cloud, SSH server, HDFS, or even local HDD RAID.

* Makes projects **reproducible** and **shareable**; helping to answer questions about how
   a model was built.

* Helps manage experiments with Git tags/branches and **metrics** tracking.

**DVC** aims to replace spreadsheet and document sharing tools (such as Excel or Google Docs)
which are being used frequently as both knowledge repositories and team ledgers.
DVC also replaces both ad-hoc scripts to track, move, and deploy different model versions;
as well as ad-hoc data file suffixes and prefixes.
